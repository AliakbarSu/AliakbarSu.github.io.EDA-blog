            <h1 class="main-post-heading">The Importance of EQ and IQ</h1>
            <h2 class="post-sub-heading">What is EQ?</h2>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                EQ aka Emotional Intelligence is the ability to monitor and control your personal emotions through which you can empathise, solve conflicts, and communicate effectively with others. This will lead to building stronger relationships and helps you to overcome challenges in life. EQ also help you to recognise your needs and  find a way to meet those needs. Having good relationships with others and being able to communicate at workplace or school enables you to cope with challenges and difficult times that you may face at that place. Eventually, overcoming those challenges leads you to succeed in that area.

            <h2 class="post-sub-heading">Difference Between IQ and EQ</h2>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                Intelligence quotient is another big contributor to success in ones' life and it works hand in hand with EQ. However, IQ is different to EQ. IQ focuses on a person's ability to observe and process information, the higher IQ you have the better and faster you can process information and also recall that information. IQ plays a big role in areas where human emotions is not important e.g solving a math problem. However, low EQ stops you from reaching you peak at IQ because if you can't manage your own emotions and needs it could lead to depression, anxiety, and many other mental and physical health problems. Therefore, it is important to improve your EQ as it is a set of skills and with any other skill it can be gained and improved through practice.
