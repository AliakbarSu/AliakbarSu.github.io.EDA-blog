            <p class="paragraphs">
                My core values could be summed up in kindness, honesty, and unconditional love. Kindness is the value that I care a lot about as its the core value behind all other values to me. Kindness could be very vague in action, it could be as simple us being kind to yourself when you do something wrong instead of blaming yourself for it just remind yourself that its ok and everything will be ok. Or it could be smiling to a stranger.
            </p>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                Without being honest, I cannot trust myself. In the same way if someone else is not being honest with me I tend not to trust them although, I would still care for them and love them regardless. There have been instances where I had to choose honesty over personal gains and I had always gone ahead with the first. I used to work for a startup company last year as a freelancer. At the end of the day I had to report back to the manager as how many hours I had spent to do the work so I had the chance to get paid for more hours than I had worked for but I stayed honest and reported back the actual amount of time I had spent to do the task.
