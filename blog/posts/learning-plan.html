        <h1 class="main-post-heading">My Learning plan</h1>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I just love solving problems whether its as simple as just trying to
          find a solution to how get a fridge into the house through the front
          door or as complex as trying to build a multi-functional robot. The
          feeling that I get after solving a problem is what brought me into web
          development in the first place. I learned to make websites just for
          fun by watching youtube videos here and there but when sometimes last
          year when I decided to pursue web development as a career I realised
          how much knowledge and soft skills I lacked so decided to join EDA
          with the hope to develop my skillset further and meet same-minded
          people.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          I used to be very shy as a kid and I would communicate very less with
          other kid at my age, therefore, I lack commutation skills in some
          areas and English being as my second language does not help at all,
          but I have come along way since those days. Joining EDA, I believe
          would give me the opportunity to interact with same minded people
          where I can apply skills that I learn through the human skills thats
          part of their curriculum.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          When I applied for EDA, I knew there is going to be times when I have
          to decide between hanging out friends or pursuing other hobbies on the
          weekend or my free time and I made a commitment to my self to choose
          study over all others which will help me to achieve my final goal.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          My strength lies in my self-motivated attitude toward learning. Once I
          decided that I want to learn something I need that knowledge to
          develop further I can become very devote to that. I had memories where
          I was so involved in a top that I had to remind myself to eat, that's
          probably a bit over exaggeration.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraphs">
          But from my experience that I have from high school, I am not very
          good at structured learning, or learning just for the sake of learning
          and hopping that it might come handy someday. If a topic does not
          interest me I will have a hard time putting my mind into it. My
          strategy to this issue is to find learning materials which teach that
          topic in a fun way so even if there's no other motivation behind
          learning it I would still do it just for the fun which at the end I
          learn something from it. Another quality that I would love to see
          further develop in myself is asking for help. I tend not to ask for
          help and solve everything by myself which in some cases in the cost of
          abandoning the issue altogether. My technique to cope with this at EDA
          is to challenge myself by asking for help if I wasn't able to solve a
          problem by myself after the 2nd try and reach out to my facilitator or
          others.
