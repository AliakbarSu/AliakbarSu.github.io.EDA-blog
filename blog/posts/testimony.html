            <h1 class="main-post-heading">My Testimony</h1>
            <p class="paragraphs">
                My name is Ali and I was born and raised in a Muslim family, being raised in a Muslim family I was living my life as an other muslim would, in an Islamic country, growing up I was told to pray 5 times a day, read the Quran as often I as could, and fast during the month of Ramadan from dawn till dusk. These are the basics thing you expect a Muslim to do. During those years I considered myself a decent Muslim but it wasn’t till the later years in my high school that things changed in my life. I started to lose faith in my religion. In 2019 I did a biology class at high school that changed my perspective on the universe and humanity all together. In that class we were taught about human evolution and how humans used to be animals and then slowly over millions of years evolved into the modern human being. That fascinated me enough to dive deeper into the study of how the universe was created. Obviously as a Muslim it contradicted with my perspective on human creation, at that time I believed that Adam and Eve was creating by God in the modern form of human being along with other creatures in this world in their modern forms. However, the topic was new and fascinating enough that I would go and study more about it in my free time. So I started by watching Youtube videos on how the world was created and all the creation within it. I started to believe them as they sounded very convincing at that time due to the evolutionary evidence they were claiming to be backing up their arguments. I could say I was more of an atheist than a Muslim at that point in my life. For a good couple of days I was arguing with people on Youtube videos in the comment section and trying to convince them that humans did evolve from animals and the Big Bang theory was true. Although they didn’t buy into my perspective, I did come to realise that it didn’t make much sense to myself either. How can the universe be created out of nothing without any supernatural power? It was around the same time that the pandemic happened and we went to a full lockdown where I used to live.

                I have always been a very ambitious guy. Since  a very young age I had goals of becoming someone like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg not necessarily for the sake of money but more to create something that could affect the lives of many. Back to the story, with all the free time in my hands during the lockdown, I started to work on a mobile game project that I started earlier that year but couldn’t continue because of school and my part-time job. I was working from morning till evening and staying up till late to work on this game project. This continued  for a couple of weeks and I made very good progress but eventually it led to a burn out. I was tired of it, I didn’t want to continue anymore and honestly the project was nowhere near the end. I started to feel very depressed and sad. Nothing gave me joy and happiness anymore, I was feeling like a failure. So just to feel a little bit better I started some very destructive habits which my whole life I looked at as very sinful acts and that gave me a very sense of shame and guilt. As I was a very shy guy and didn’t really know how to connect with people I didn’t have many close friends who I could talk to and I didn’t feel close to my parents either. I felt alone, broken.

                I had started a new job and I had a colleague who happened to be very warm and friendly and for the first time I felt that I could talk to that person without being judged so I texted that colleague if we could meet up.

            <p class="paragraphs">
                Since I do not have the consent of my colleague to mention the identity,  for the rest of this testimony I going to refer to my colleague as my friend and give it the name of Hope.

            <p class="paragraphs">
                After sharing a little bit of what I was going through at that time I felt very light as some burdens were lifted off my shoulders. During the conversations I realised that Hope was also a christian so I asked what christians believe about Jesus being the son of god.

                As a Muslim, I always thought that christian are worshipping three gods and that just by itself made to never actually consider exploring Christianity. As Hope explained the concept of trinity of how god can appear in different ways but still being the same one god, it started to fire spark in my head.

              One morning as I was traveling from my place to my parents' place I passed by a christian book store, so I decided to hope in and get myself a bible. I ended up getting the new testament NIV version. Reading through the Gospel of Mathew was a very novel experience for me, I had never read any book like that before. The bible just drew me into itself. I was reading pages after pages non-stop. Everything just clicked and made sense to me. During that time I asked my friend if they could take me to the church with them, so fast-forward a couple of days I attended the first service at a local baptist church. I had been to a church before but not to attend a sermon but rather to visit the building. Being there gave me a sense of peace, purpose, and joy. Since that time I have visited and been to many different churches but that particularly church has a special place in my heart as it was the start of my walk with christ and sort of my spiritual home.

              I had just finished a very tiring shift at work, my body and eyes were shutting down involuntarily so I quickly walked back to my apartment, took a shower and laid in my bed. I was putting on an eye mask because I was working night shifts and sleeping with the sunlight coming throw the window was very difficult. As I was going to sleep, I heard a clear smooth voice , saying "Follow Me". All of a sudden I freaked out and jump out of my blanket as I turned my head toward the door I saw my monitor which was next to my bed had turned completely white. I was pretty sure the monitor was turned off but I double checked it by unplugging it from the wall, but it stayed on, as fear was building up in my body I run out of the apartment and spent the next hour or so down in the cafe of my apartment. I was confused and scared as to what I had witnessed. growing up I had never encounter such a thing. It was even more surprising as there was no one else in the apartment. My flatmate used to leave for work early in the morning so it was just me there at that time. As I met my christian friend later in the week I told Hope what I had experienced. My friend said that it could've been anything but there is a high chance that it was Jesus saying those words, and suggested if it was the case I could pray about it and he would reveal himself to me again. I didn't believe Hope at that time, I thought that it was because I had been reading the bible non-stop and thinking about christianity a lot so my mind was playing tricks on me. However, I took in the advice and prayed about it that was when I had two other encounters with Jesus in dreams. I had a dream of Jesus speaking some words to me which I later found out that it was a verse from the scripture and in another dream I saw him distributing something to a crowd of people.

              A couple of weeks after that I decided that I want to declare Jesus as my lord and saviour, and since then my life have never been the same, I'm no longer the same person, my perspective towards life has changed. There are still times when I feel same way prior to finding Jesus, but now I know that no matter what happens, I have somebody who cares for me, loves me and would help me in any situation because I am not alone.
