          Javascript is what makes a website interactive and by interactive I
          mean actionable for example when you click on button on a website, the
          code that tells when the button is clicked play the sound is written
          in JavaScript. HTML and CSS are just there to display content and
          style those content so they cannot make your webpage interactive.
          However, it is worth mentioning that there are some HTML element that
          are interactive by default for example clicking on a button that has
          the type 'submit' make make the HTML form to pass the form inputs to a
          web address e.g http://something.

          The browser where you Javascript codes are executed run them in an
          order from top to bottom so if you write some code at the top of a
          JavaScript file that code will be executed first and then the code
          that is sitting at the bottom of that JavaScript file. There might be
          instances where you want a code to be executed multiple times in a row
          for example you might want the browser replay a song in a loop unless
          the user presses stop. This is where loops comes in you can surround
          the specific code that is responsible for replaying the song inside a
          loop statement and set the condition to the user's response. Now the
          browser starts reading and executing your codes from the start of the
          JS file and when it reaches to the loop statement it executes the code
          inside the loop until the condition on the loop statement is true,
          once it is false it continues to execute the rest of the codes as
          usual. So you can use loop statement to change the flow of code
          execution in JavaScript.

        <div class="code">
          <p>
            // Some other code

            <span class="space-code"></span>

            loopTill(userReplay == true) {

            <span class="space-code"></span>

            // the code responsible for replaying the song

            <span class="space-code"></span>
            }
            <span class="space-code"></span>

          Functions in JavaScript allows you to run a specific piece of code
          multiple times in different part of your JS file without having to
          copy and paste your code in multiple places. It is like a container
          that you could put your code in and name that container something
          declarative e.g playSong which you can run later in a different part
          of your code just by specifying the name of that function.
        </p>
        <div class="code">
          <p>
            // The code inside playSong is not run at this time
            <span class="space-code"></span>
            playSong() {
            <span class="space-code"></span>
            // Your code that play a song in the browser
            <span class="space-code"></span>
            }

            <span class="space-code"></span>
            // This will run the code inside playSong function playSong();

          The DOM is a representation of all the element inside the HTML
          document i.e html file. It is sorted in a tree like shape where Window
          which is the root of the tree and each html element is a branch of
          that tree. Each element is a branch of its parent element. For example
          if you have a <code class="code-element">&lt;p></code> inside a
          <code class="code-element">&lt;div></code> the you can access the
          <code class="code-element">&lt;p></code> element through
          <code class="code-element">&lt;div></code> object, although there are
          ways to access it directly as well.

          DevTools are browser's features which allow you to access and interact
          with the DOM on the fly you could add, edit, and delete elements in
          the DOM. It also gives you other functionality that are very helpful
          when developing a web app for example you could get statistic on how
          fast the pages are loading which files are loading and a bunch of
          other features.
