            <p class="paragraphs">
                Neuroplasticity in a nutshell is that "Neurons that fire together, wire together." which means that if you practice an activity it 
                creates actual physical electrochemical pathways in your brain and those pathways can be strengthened by repetition. This is a huge 
                breakthrough in the field of brain science as knowing this enable us to get better at an activity by just practicing regardless of 
                your talent. A lot of people think that they cannot get good at something because they are not talented enough but it is actually 
                not true. There are many studies researches which proves that just thinking about doing an activity makes neurons related to that 
                activity stronger as much as physically doing that activity. When it comes to studying e.g coding just telling yourself that you 
                can get good at coding as a professional programmer and with enough practice you can achieve that.

            <p class="paragraphs">
                A lot of people especially students think you they are born with a set amount of ability and that they cannot improve beyond that, 
                that is what physiologists call a fixed mindset. Human brains are capable of growing and creating more neuron network and there 
                is no limit for that no matter your age, gender. A growth mindset is the opposite of above in which you don't limit yourself to 
                amount of skills you have but instead you try to improve by learning  and practicing practicing and knowing that your brain is 
                capable of taking new information and becoming good at that activity.

                I started to learn guitar last year and at the beginning I felt that I could not get better my abilities were the same even after 
                practicing for a while and I was basically near to give up. However, continuing to practice for countless hours I started to see 
                progress and my finger were automatically pressing the correct string by just thinking about the chorus. Know that I have learned 
                about Neuroplasticity and growth mindset I can relate it back to my journey of learning to play guitar. Having this knowledge help 
                me to apply them in practicing my coding skills and keep myself motivated when things get though during the bootcamp.
